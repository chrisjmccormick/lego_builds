The digital design file is `Serrye Volki.io`. You can open in it in BrickLink's Stud.io program.

I did a video review of this build, you can find it on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZV0k_5zTOw).

### Original by Benjamin Cheh

This mech design is my attempt at replicating the original by Benjamin Cheh:

### Current state of the digital design:

I'm calling this project "done" for now, and I think the design file is in a very good state, but know that it's not 100% perfect. I'll discuss the concerns below.

Maybe I'll come back to it later on, and I think my future digital designs will hit a higher standard. 

*Part Variants*

* Some LEGO parts have alternate versions, and when building in the digital designer it's not always obvious which variant is the right one to use. In some cases, I may have used the "wrong" variant--meaning that part doesn't actually exist in that color, or it's a much rarer part than its alternate. 
* To fix this, when you export the part list and upload it to Bricklink, BrickLink will point out which parts don't actually exist. 
* Also, when you go to order the parts, you can check the prices to see if there any that seem unreasonably expensive for what they are--that's usually a good indication that I used the wrong variant!

*Tweaks*

I did some further tweaks while building the physical model. I tried to update the design with these tweaks, but I can't guarantee that I captured all of them.
