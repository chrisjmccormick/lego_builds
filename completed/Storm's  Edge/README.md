# Storm's Edge

My replica of <a href=”https://www.flickr.com/photos/tardisblue/25905450946/”>Nick Trotta’s Storm’s Edge!</a>

Nick made this easy for me by providing a step-by-step [build video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEzdVmqiWWo) for the model. I followed that and built the ship in Stud.io so that I could generate a parts list. 

The final model file is in this directory (`2021-11-16 - Storm's Edge - Final.io`). I also organized the digital model into build steps so that it was easier to assemble once I had all the pieces! 



# Storm's Edge Stand

**TODO** - Move the files over? And update description.

I've finished an initial revision of the stand Nick Trotta built for [Storm's Edge](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tardisblue/25905450946/). 

Obviously the *ship* is the real star of the show, but I'd like to use the stand to display a couple other ships I have, and thought other people might value the design.

I didn't have very detailed images to work off of, so it's not as close of a replica as my other digital designs. In particular I know Nick's stand has a little more going on in the center of the base.

Next step is to order some parts and build it, and work out any final kinks in the design!
